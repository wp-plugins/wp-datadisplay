This plugin creates a custom post type that displays data of several database tables based on a unique ID.

== Description ==
This plugins is used to display custom data using custom post types. It allows users to upload databases and generate posts to display this data. Each row of the database generates one post following the specifications of a template that states where each field appears.

How to use:

1) Create a "main" table in your database with the appropriate prefix (see wpdd_config.php). This table needs one column called ID.
2) Upload other tables. They must also have a column called ID, which will be associated to the main table.
3) In the plugin setting, set up the datadisplay title template.
4) Click on generate posts. For each row on main table, it will create one post (posttype datadisplay). Post title and content will follow the template.
